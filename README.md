PJ1 - Data Analysis on Internships in India (AUG 2023)

**Project Overview:**
Project PJ1, abbreviated as "Project 1," is an initiative aimed at conducting comprehensive data analysis on internship opportunities available in India as of August 2023. The project involves the process of data scraping and mining from the popular internship listing website, Internshala (internshala.com/internships). The collected data will be organized into specific columns for further analysis and insights.

**Project Objectives:**
The primary objectives of PJ1 are as follows:

Data Collection: Extract internship-related information from Internshala's internship listings, including company names, internship titles, locations, and stipends.

Data Structuring: Organize the collected data into structured columns to enable efficient analysis and visualization.
Insights Generation: Perform data analysis on the collected information to gain insights into trends, distribution of internships, stipend ranges, and popular locations.

Data Visualization: Create visual representations such as graphs, charts, and plots to present the findings in an understandable and visually appealing manner.

**Project Steps:**
The project will be executed through the following steps:

Data Scraping: Utilize web scraping techniques to retrieve data from Internshala's internship listings. This will involve accessing each page of internships and extracting relevant information such as company names, internship titles, locations, and stipends.

Data Cleaning: Process the collected data to remove any inconsistencies, irrelevant information, or redundant characters. Cleaned data will be essential for accurate analysis.

Data Structuring: Organize the cleaned data into specific columns such as "Company Name," "Title," "Location," and "Stipend." This structuring will facilitate easy handling and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the collected data. This may involve calculating statistics, identifying popular locations, and determining common stipend ranges.

Data Visualization: Create various visual representations, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms, to visually present the findings and insights derived from the data.

**Project Documentation:**
Document the entire process, including the code used for scraping, data cleaning, and analysis, along with explanations. This documentation will serve as a reference for others and aid in replicating the project.

**Benefits and Impact:**
PJ1 aims to provide valuable insights into the current landscape of internship opportunities in India. It will enable students, job seekers, and employers to gain a better understanding of the distribution of internships across different locations, stipend ranges, and industries. The project's results can be used to make informed decisions about pursuing internships and to tailor internship offerings to better match student preferences.

**GitHub Repository:**
The code, documentation, and findings of PJ1 will be hosted in a GitHub repository. The repository will include:

Data scraping code to collect internship information from Internshala.
Data cleaning and structuring code to organize the data into columns.
Exploratory data analysis code to derive insights from the data.
Visualizations created using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
A comprehensive README file explaining the project, its objectives, steps, and key findings.
Relevant files such as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script used for analysis.
Conclusion:
Project PJ1 aims to enhance our understanding of the internship landscape in India through data analysis. By scraping, structuring, and analyzing data from Internshala, the project will provide valuable insights that can benefit students, employers, and the internship ecosystem as a whole. The GitHub repository will serve as a valuable resource for others interested in internship trends and data analysis techniques.
